	                    <p>To be fully-admitted, we will need to receive official transcripts from all universities and postsecondary schools that you have attended. If you have less than 30 transferable college credits, we will also need an official high school or GED transcript. Credits are considered transferable if they are from 100 level or higher courses with a "C" or better average from an accredited university. A transcript is "official" only when we receive it in a sealed envelope from the awarding institution. You may have them sent directly to us or deliver it yourself as long as it is still sealed. Please use admissions@alaskapacific.edu if the institution delivers transcripts electronically.</p>
